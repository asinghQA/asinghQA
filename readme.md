Mobile Automation Testing Frameworks and Tools
This hybrid framework is automated using various types of drivers and is supported for the following platforms:

Android (UiAutomator2)
iOS (XCUITest)
Test Suite Execution Flow
Jenkins Integration:
The automation test suite is initiated through Jenkins.
Jenkins executes the Maven build tool.
TestNG Execution:
The Maven build triggers the execution of a TestNG file.
The TestNG file launches the test suite.
Appium Integration:
The test suite communicates with the Appium server.
Appium acts as a bridge between the automation test code and the testing device.
This enables the automation testing of UI functionalities.
Key Tools Used
Appium:
Simplifies mobile app automation by leveraging the WebDriver protocol.
Provides a consistent approach for testing across diverse platforms.
Maven:
Improves the build process, provides project information, and encourages best practices for Java-based projects.
TestNG:
Provides a flexible and robust testing framework for Java applications.
Covers various testing scenarios.
Selenium Grid:
Empowers efficient, scalable, and cross-browser testing by distributing test execution across multiple machines.
Extent Report:
Enhances test reporting by providing detailed, interactive, and visually appealing reports.
Sikuli:
Used to automate GUI interactions by leveraging image recognition.
Valuable for both web and desktop automation.
Specifically used for handling map interactions like pan, edit features, and zoom.
Capabilities
Parallel Execution:
Allows parallel execution of tests.
Cross-Platform Testing:
Supports multiple operating systems for compatibility testing.
Device Compatibility:
Supports different types of devices.
Real Device Testing:
Can run on real devices for both Android and iOS.
